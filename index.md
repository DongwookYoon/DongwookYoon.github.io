![Dongwook's headshot](/files/profile.jpg)

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, and a member of [IMAGER](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager){:target="_blank"}, [MAGIC](http://www.magic.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"}, and [Design for People](http://apsc-hci.sites.olt.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"}.

You can reach me at [yoon.at.cs.ubc.ca](#){:onclick="return false;"} or visit me at [X663, ICICS/CS](https://goo.gl/maps/imJwWLmVLev){:target="_blank"}.

My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), computer-mediated communication (CMC), and educational technology. My primary research focus is to build **rich collaboration systems** that offer expressive multimodal interactions, i.e., interactions through multiple communication channels (e.g., speech, gesture, and grasp). My design approach translates natural human interactions into novel combinations of input modalities that serve as building blocks for fluid, rich, and lightweight interfaces. My evaluation approach deploys and evaluates high-fidelity systems in real world contexts (e.g., classrooms), from which we can obtain ecologically valid user data.

I received a Ph.D. in Information Science from Cornell University, and a M.S. in Computer Graphics and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Seoul National University.

# Working with me

I am inviting UBC students at any level (B.S., M.S., Ph.D.) to contact me if you are interested in doing HCI research with me.

[comment]: # (Statistics. HCI course. Read my research papers. Email me. Who you are. Your interest, background and skills. If you are looking for an advisor or an committee member for you M.S./Ph.D. study, and/or a funded RAship, please say the up front in your email e.g., I think you could be my potential advisor, and need funding.)
