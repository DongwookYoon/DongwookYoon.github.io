        <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
        <p>Dongwook Yoon is an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, and a member of Designing for People (DFP) and CAIDA. His overarching goal is to make computer-mediated social interactions richer, more inclusive, and more humane. He attends to problem domains where technology design does not match the social process. To make the technology fit human social interactions, his research assesses user needs in socio-technical systems and addresses such needs by realizing and testing novel design interventions.</p>
        <p>Yoon is a recipient of multiple prestigious awards, including Google Academic Research Awards (2024) and the CHCCS/SCDHM Graphics Interface Early Career Researcher Award (2023). His work has also been recognized with Best Paper Awards at CHI (2024), High-Impact Award from the International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education (2024), Honorable Mention Awards at DIS (2022) and CHI (2019), and an Impact Recognition Award at CSCW (2021). During his Ph.D. studies, he was awarded the Kwanjeong Educational Foundation Scholarship (2012-2017).</p><p>
            He earned his Ph.D. from Cornell in 2017; and his M.S. and B.S. from Seoul National University in 2009 and 2007, respectively.
            His research and training programs are supported by generous funds from

        <h2>Prospective students</h2>
        <p>
            I have openings for three graduate students to join my lab at MSc or PhD level for the next admission cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            UBC students at any level (B.S., M.S., Ph.D.) are welcome to contact me for potential advising and collaboration. For the currently available graduate RA-ship or undergraduate internship positions, please check detailed descriptions of the ongoing projects here:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRUvK5wGmIZY7ZKeWg-XWW3P1w1qF5rfMQhnbw2IQ7Y/edit" target="_blank">Ongoing research projects</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When contacting me, please include the following information.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who you are. I want to know which year and program you are in and what kind of skill set you have. If you wish me as a committee member, please indicate your supervisor. Attaching your transcript, CV/resume, or portfolio is the easiest way to go.</li>
            <li>Your need. Are you looking for an advisor, a committee member, a funded RAship, or just research experience? Please be upfront about what you want to get out of the meeting. If needs be, please share your academic timeline.</li>
            <li>Your research interest. What do you want to study, and why do you think I might be a good fit? To answer these, you would need to watch the videos of my projects and then read the papers that you consider particularly interesting. After that, you could propose a research idea. If you don’t have one, please state your area of interest instead; then, I might suggest a topic or invite you to work on an ongoing project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I hope we will have the opportunity to work together. If you have self-motivation, commitment, and passion for quality research, I will find resources to support your work and give you feedback to advance your practice.
        </p>
